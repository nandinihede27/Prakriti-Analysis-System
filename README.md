# Prakriti-Analysis-System
The Prakriti Analysis System is a web-based project that identifies the three main doshas -Vata, Pitta, and Kapha based on user responses. The system was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for an interactive and responsive frontend, and MySQL for backend database management to store user data and assessment results efficiently.
